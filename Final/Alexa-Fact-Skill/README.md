# Simple Fact Skill Calling an API

## What You Will Need
* [Amazon Developer Account](http://developer.amazon.com/alexa)
* This sample code

## Setting Up the Demo
If you use Alexa hosted, follow the steps:

1. Create a new Alexa Hosted skill using Node.js
2. Copy paste the file models/en-US.json into the json editor of the interaction model. 
3. Build your interaction model and skill changes.
4. Go to the *Code* tab. Copy paste the index.js into the index.js file already in your hosted environment. (SkillCode > lambda > index.js)
5. Deploy and enjoy!

You will most likely want to change the invocation name in the interaction model to fit your fact skill.

## Running the Demo
To start the demo say "Alexa, open space facts" or "Alexa, ask space facts for a fact"
